Music App
=========

ABDN project.
=============


About the project:

* App work with bound service - here I have a lot of troubles, but finally start working. 

* Notification to the user that provides action buttons Play/Stop, Next, Previous. Song title too.

* App has two activities. First is the main player activity where the user has all control over the player.

* Next one is List Activity, where data is populated to ListView with List Adapter implementing ViewHolder.

* Simple buttons animations, and little stupid playing animation that has to be fixed.

* after first install I run background code to upload some very nice free music files on Public External Device Storage.

  This code is run only once on install. For that emulator will need some space to install the app.


NOTE: After install, it is important to re-run application.
